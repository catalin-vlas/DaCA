Web Data Commons Analyzer


Create a Web tool able to perform various processing tasks regarding the meta-data available in RDFa and HTML5 microdata 
formats provided by the Web Data Commons. Using a modular approach, a minimal set of operations will be implemented: visualize,
clasify, compare, and match/align. The queries will be performed via a SPARQL endpoint, the obtained results being available in 
HTML and JSON(-LD) formats. Various statistics, modeled with the RDF Data Cube vocabulary, will be also exposed.
